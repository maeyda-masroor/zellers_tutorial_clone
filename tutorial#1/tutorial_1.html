            HEY! IT’S BEEN A MINUTE. DID WE MISS ANYTHING?
        </h1>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 20px;">
            We know, we know. We look a little different from when we first threw open our doors back in (deep breath!) 1931. But we don’t feel a day over 28. And we do water sports.
            <br>
            People are talking, and we can feel the love. We’ll never forget where we came from; but we’re pretty excited about where we’re going, too. We’re here to become your new favourite spot for design and value, from lifestyle to home and almost everything in between (with plenty of toys for the little ones, obvs).
            <pre>
            That means you can expect a helpful, playful shopping experience packed full of low prices day in, day out.

            Anyway, enough about us. Thanks for stopping by. We missed your face.

        <p style="font-size: 20px; color: black;font-family: Arial;">
            We’re pretty tight with Hudson’s Bay, and they love to share. So you can fill up your online cart at both</p>
             <p style="text-decoration: underline;">zellers.ca</p> and <p style="text-decoration: underline;">thebay.com</p> and only have to check out once. Easy peasy.
